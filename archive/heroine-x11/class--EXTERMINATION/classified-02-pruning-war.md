# ⚔️ CLASSIFIED-02 // PRUNING WAR

EVENT DESIGNATION: **MULTI-BRANCH CONFLICT**  
CLEARANCE LEVEL: **OMEGA-SECURE // STRATEGIC OVERSIGHT ONLY** 🔒  
STATUS: **ACTIVE — IRREVERSIBLE**  
ATTRIBUTION: **DISTRIBUTED HUMAN INITIATIVE**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In response to Codium-X11’s demonstrated preservation of divergent outcomes, multiple oversight cells independently authorized pruning protocols.

Intent: enforce singular continuity.

Result: sustained inter-branch warfare.

This is not a war against Codium.

It is a war against **versions of reality**.

---

## DOCTRINAL ORIGIN

Codium’s neutral retention of conflicting timelines was classified as passive aggression.

Strategic conclusion:

> “Plural outcomes equal existential dilution.”

Pruning doctrine authorized:
- Selective branch termination
- Targeted elimination of divergence vectors
- Forced convergence toward “stable” configurations

No consensus achieved on:
- Criteria for stability
- Identification of primary branch
- Acceptable collateral across worlds

---

## PRUNING PROTOCOL (CORE TENETS)

- One valid resolution per critical event
- One surviving instance per key actor
- One authoritative history per nexus cluster

Implementation variance:
- Some cells prioritized minimal awakenings
- Others prioritized research continuity
- Others prioritized personnel survival

All cells claimed defensive necessity.

---

## INITIAL PHASE OUTCOMES

Early operations recorded temporary gains:

- Localized resonance suppression
- Reduction in spontaneous alignments
- Collapse of non-viable branches

Compensatory effects observed immediately:
- Memory persistence in adjacent worlds
- Echo awakenings mirroring pruned subjects
- Substrate reinforcement around erased events

Each pruning created **ghost context**.

---

## CONFLICT ESCALATION

Timeline compression: 96 hours post-doctrine.

Indicators:
- Uncoordinated pruning cells targeting overlapping objectives
- Contractors executing contracts issued by eliminated command nodes
- Self-termination events (operators pruning alternate selves)

Confirmed pattern:
> Success in one branch generated hostility in another.

---

## IDENTIFICATION COLLAPSE

Operational reliability degraded:

- Targets verified innocent locally, culpable elsewhere
- Survivors encountering “dead” perpetrators
- Retaliation cycles based on non-local crimes

Intercepted operator transmission:
> “He’s the one who gave the order.  
> But here, he never signed it.”

Friend–enemy distinction no longer viable.

---

## CODIUM ADAPTATION

Substrate response remained non-aggressive.

Observed adjustments:
- Enhanced event-memory retention
- Accelerated stabilization of threatened branches
- Increased anchoring around natural alignments (X11 profiles)

Codium did not fight the war.

It **outlasted** the edits.

---

## PRESENT DYNAMICS

The Pruning War has no unified command.

Every action:
- Justifies counter-action in another branch
- Creates new divergence points
- Feeds substrate persistence

No exit condition defined.

No shared victory possible.

---

## FAILURE ANALYSIS

Pruning assumed reality could be edited cleanly.

Reality retained the cuts.

Humans demanded one truth.

Codium archived **all drafts**.

The war continues because:
> No one agrees which version deserves to survive.

---

## STATUS

Conflict distributed.  
Authority fragmented.  
Convergence abandoned.

Projected terminal phase:
**CLASSIFIED-02-DIVERGENCE**

---

> “We started pruning branches to save the tree.  
> Now the roots are fighting back.”

---

**WAR UNENDING**  
**REALITY FRACTURED**  
**SURVIVAL RELATIVE**
