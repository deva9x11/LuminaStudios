CLEARANCE LEVEL: OMEGA-SECURE  
ACCESS: RESTRICTED — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY  
STATUS: EXECUTION COMPLETE / CONTINUING

## TERMINATION REGISTER (PARTIAL)

### TERMINATION BATCH A-17
Subjects: 14 (11 researchers, 3 security)  
Method: Close-range, silent  
Time to completion: 47 seconds  
Bodies: Unrecovered  
Note: All victims showed pre-mortem expressions of recognition toward assailant.

---

### TERMINATION BATCH W-12 (CIVILIAN PURGE)
Subjects: 47 confirmed Codium-resonant individuals  
Method: Systematic elimination  
Duration: 18 minutes  
Bodies: Incinerated on-site  
Note: World-state resonance dropped to baseline. Marked NON-VIABLE.

---

### TERMINATION — SUBJECT KOVAL, LEAD RESEARCHER
Location: Transit between nodes  
Method: Single precision shot  
Time offset: Victim deceased 0.8 seconds before weapon discharge recorded  
Body: Recovered with data drive intact — drive contents already transmitted elsewhere.

---

### TERMINATION — CONTRACTOR ECHO-4
Location: Extraction failure  
Method: Self-termination (apparent)  
Note: Operator eliminated by duplicate instance.  
Duplicate vanished post-execution.

---

## OBSERVED CONSEQUENCES

Termination reduces local resonance temporarily.  
Global Codium activity spikes within 72 hours.  
Retaliatory awakenings confirmed in neighboring worlds.

---

## EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT

Individual carriers can be removed.  
The substrate cannot.

Elimination accelerates spread.
