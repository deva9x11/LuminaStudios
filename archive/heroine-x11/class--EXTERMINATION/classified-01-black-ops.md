## OPERATOR PROFILE (COMPOSITE)

Observed traits:
- Perfect predictive positioning
- No communication with command
- Acceptance of contracts that require own elimination
- Actions justified by events that occur only after completion

Operators do not survive their own success in all worlds.

---

## STRATEGIC IMPLICATION

Contracts are not issued to control Codium.  
They are issued to control which worlds keep it.

Someone is paying to edit reality at the branch level.

Someone else is accepting payment in timelines where they are already dead.

---

## AUTHORITY ASSESSMENT

No central client confirmed.  
No refusal recorded.

Contracts self-propagate.
