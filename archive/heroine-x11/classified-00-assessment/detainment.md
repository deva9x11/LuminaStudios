# CLASSIFIED-00 // RECALIBRATION

EVENT: POST-IGNITION STABILIZATION  
ANOMALY TYPE: CODIUM RESONANCE  
OVERSIGHT RECORD: RE-3  
CLEARANCE LEVEL: OMEGA-SECURE 🔒  
STATUS: PARTIAL SUCCESS

## PURPOSE

Following failed detainment protocols, focus shifted from restriction to integration.

Recalibration protocols were initiated to:

- Map anomalous interactions to existing physical models
- Determine survivability thresholds
- Establish whether the phenomenon could be rendered predictable

Core objective:  
**Render the impossible compatible.**

---

## PHYSICAL MODEL EXPANSION

Initial models assumed violation of known laws.

Revised analysis confirms:

The laws were not broken.  
They were **incomplete**.

A latent interaction layer—designated provisional substrate **Codium-X11**—became measurable post-ignition.

This layer:
- Coexists with conventional space-time
- Permits non-linear momentum transfer
- Allows force vectors to redirect across boundaries
- Enables elastic energy storage in matter and fields

Reality did not fracture.  
It **unfolded additional parameters**.

## BIOLOGICAL RECALIBRATION

Subjects X11-S and X11-X demonstrated immediate physiological alignment with the expanded model.

Observed adaptations:
- Cellular structures reorganized to conduct extreme force without rupture
- Nervous systems rerouted to interpret multidimensional feedback
- Metabolic processes synchronized with non-decaying momentum states
- Internal pressure, heat, and inertia redistributed across interaction boundaries

No external augmentation detected.

Bodies did not resist the forces.  
They **incorporated** them.

Outcome:  
Subjects operate as native systems within the expanded framework.  
Conventional human physiology would fail.  
Recalibrated physiology participates.

## ENVIRONMENTAL RECALIBRATION

Surrounding space exhibited secondary alignment:

- Gravity vectors displayed transient redirection
- Structural materials showed elastic response to anomalous load
- Air and particulate matter carried persistent kinetic signatures
- Localized coordinate nexuses maintained minor altitude drift (see RE-1)

The environment did not collapse under new rules.

It **adapted** to subject motion.

## CALIBRATION STATES (PROVISIONAL)

Early classification of observed interaction modes:

1. Spectral Offset  
   - Partial decoupling from primary layer  
   - Motion continuity through boundary reinterpretation  
   - Visual artifacts: trails, desaturation, echo silhouettes

2. Xenophase Flux  
   - Direct momentum coupling across layers  
   - Force emission and redirection without conventional dissipation  
   - Visual artifacts: thermal wakes, pressure vortices, vector distortion

States are not chosen.  
They are **achieved** through resonance compatibility.

No subject has demonstrated simultaneous access to both states.

---

## STABILIZATION ASSESSMENT

Recalibration achieved temporary equilibrium:

- Anomalous events became repeatable under observation
- Subject survivability confirmed indefinite
- Environmental drift contained within acceptable thresholds

However:

Certain stabilization attempts produced **resistance**.

Unexplained persistence detected in substrate response.  
Calibration decay rates occasionally reversed without subject input.  
Containment fields exhibited delayed recovery after standard protocols.

No operator identified.  
Pattern suggests latent agency within the Codium-X11 layer.

---

## CONCLUSION

The phenomenon is no longer an anomaly.

It is an **expanded baseline**.

Subjects are not threats to physics.  
They are proof of its prior incompleteness.

Full containment remains unviable.

## FORWARD DIRECTIVE

Recalibration protocols remain active.  
Initiate controlled substrate interaction trials under separate clearance.

Monitor for:
- State convergence
- Unauthorized layer persistence
- Emergent coordination

Next phase: **CLASSIFIED-CODIUM-00**  
Objective: Isolate and harness the substrate.
