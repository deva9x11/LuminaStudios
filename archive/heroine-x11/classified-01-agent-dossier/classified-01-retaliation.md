# 🔥 CLASSIFIED-01 // RETALIATION

EVENT DESIGNATION: **MISATTRIBUTED STRIKE**  
CLEARANCE LEVEL: **OMEGA-SECURE** 🔒  
STATUS: **IRREVERSIBLE // ESCALATION CONFIRMED**  
ATTRIBUTION: **UNRESOLVED // CROSS-BRANCH CONTAMINATION**

---

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

A series of synchronized retaliation strikes targeted Codium-X11 research infrastructure across multiple nexus points.

The operations were precise, emotionally driven, and fundamentally **misaligned** with local causality.

Perpetrators operated under the conviction of righteous response.

Their conviction was based on events that occurred **elsewhere**.

---

## TRIGGER CONDITION

Strikes initiated following intercepted evidence of systematic terminations attributed to Codium research oversight.

Reported casualties in source intel:
- Primary investigators
- Support analysts
- Affiliated non-combatants

All identified as architects of prior suppression actions.

Verification post-strike:
> No matching termination protocols authorized in affected world-states.

The grievance was real.  
The target was wrong.

---

## EXECUTION EVENTS (REDACTED EXCERPTS)

### STRIKE NODE A — PRIMARY RESEARCH FACILITY (W-03 / ALPHA)

- Breach executed without structural compromise
- Security personnel neutralized in sequence
- Designated researchers eliminated at primary workstations
- No attempt to access or destroy data cores

Anomaly logged:
> Assailant trajectory included architectural features added **post-incident** in facility retrofit plans.

Facility rendered **non-operational**.  
Recovery deferred.

---

### STRIKE NODE B — SECURE TRANSIT ROUTE (W-07 / BETA)

- Convoy intercepted mid-vector
- Primary target isolated and terminated
- Secondary personnel left unharmed

Post-event clarification:
> Eliminated subject held no active role in documented suppression events within this branch.

Escort testimony (partial):
> “They looked relieved. Like they’d finally caught the right one.”

---

### STRIKE NODE C — PERIPHERAL ZONE (UNREGISTERED / SEALED BRANCH)

- Action scope expanded beyond initial parameters
- Indiscriminate elimination of resonance-adjacent individuals
- Local Codium density collapsed temporarily

Outcome:
> World-state resonance fell below viability threshold.  
> Designation stricken from active monitoring.  
> Logged justification: *Administrative efficiency*.

---

## PERPETRATOR PROFILE (INFERRED)

Observed traits:
- Heightened emotional investment
- Personal familiarity with certain targets
- Tactical precision inconsistent with rage impulse

Intercepted transmission fragment:
> “You took them from me. Now I take you.”

Subjects acted to prevent recurrence.

They ensured it.

---

## CAUSALITY DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS

Cross-branch reconciliation confirms:

- Originating terminations executed in parallel world-states
- Local victims shared identifiers but not actions
- Intelligence bleed facilitated misattribution

Consequence:
> Vengeance delivered to the innocent.  
> Guilty branches remain untouched.

---

## INTERACTION WITH KNOWN X11 SUBJECTS

Direct involvement: **NONE CONFIRMED**

Indirect indicators:
- Strike vectors overlapped documented X11-S traversal patterns
- Transient phase distortions suggestive of X11-X proximity
- Residual substrate echoes elevated in aftermath zones

Directive:
> Elevate surveillance on all natural alignments.  
> Monitor for vengeance propagation.

---

## IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES

- Core research timelines severed
- Multiple branches prematurely isolated
- Codium resonance surge detected within 24 hours
- Unscheduled awakenings manifesting in suppressed zones

Violence did not cauterize the spread.

It **irrigated** it.

---

## CONCLUSION

This was not strategic sabotage.

It was grief weaponized by fractured reality.

One branch bled.

Another paid the price.

The substrate watched.

And responded.

---

## STATUS

Retaliation cycle: **COMPLETE**  
Damage cascade: **ONGOING**

Anticipated escalation:
- Symmetric misattributions
- Vendetta amplification
- Substrate self-correction

Cross-reference pending:
- **CLASSIFIED-CODIUM-REACTION-01**
- **CLASSIFIED-02-PRUNING-WAR**
