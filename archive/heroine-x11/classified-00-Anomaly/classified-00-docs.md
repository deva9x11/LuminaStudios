CLASSIFIED-00 // ANOMALY

EVENT: IGNITION
ANOMALY TYPE: CODIUM
OVERSIGHT RECORD: RE-1
CLEARANCE LEVEL: OMEGA-SECURE

INITIAL DETECTION PROTOCOL

The anomaly did not arrive as cataclysm.

It arrived as movement behaving incorrectly.

Objects traveled farther than expected.
Momentum failed to decay.
Bodies did not slow when they should have.

Initial reports were dismissed as calibration artifacts.

Then the threshold was crossed.

A human form moved in defiance of prediction.

PRIMARY ACTIVATION SITES

Two independent activations were recorded across separate locations.

Designations:

X11-S (Spectral Variant)

X11-X (Xenophase Variant)

No shared origin.
No shared environment.
Signatures matched harmonic resonance.

Spatial anomalies registered immediately at activation.
Dimensional bleed confirmed.

COORDINATE NEXUS (PARTIAL DECRYPTION)

Interlinked loci suggest emergent multiversal tethering.
Vertical orientation destabilized.
Structures exhibited buoyancy under recalibrated fields.

Down ceased to be absolute.
Direction became intent.

NEXUS POINT ALPHA

W-03 / Φ-LAT 37.7749 / Ψ-VEC Δ-9.18
ALTITUDE DRIFT: +87m

ANOMALY: Inverted gravity wells. Debris maintains orbital suspension.
STATUS: CONTAINMENT BREACHED — FLOATING ARCHITECTURE ACTIVE.

NEXUS POINT BETA

W-07 / Φ-LAT −34.6037 / Ψ-VEC Δ+4.61
ALTITUDE DRIFT: −112m

ANOMALY: Axial skew. Pathways curve into non-linear traversal routes.
STATUS: SYNCHRONIZED OVERLAP — INTER-WORLD ECHOES DETECTED.

NEXUS POINT GAMMA (EMERGENT)

W-12 / Φ-LAT 51.5074 / Ψ-VEC Δ0.00
ALTITUDE DRIFT: VARIABLE

ANOMALY: Phased layering. Matter intermittently loses solidity.
STATUS: ESCALATING — POTENTIAL GATEWAY FORMATION.

These coordinates do not mark locations.

They mark connections.

MANIFESTED PHENOMENA

Subjects do not exceed physical limits.

They are reinterpreted by them.

Documented effects include:

Thermal afterimages without ignition source

Aerodynamic vortices channeling kinetic force

Velocity vectors unbound by friction or decay

Gravimetric distortion enabling mid-traversal reorientation

Momentum persists where it should not.

Space yields.

INTERCEPTED TRANSMISSIONS (VOICE LOGS)

Phase events produced localized resonance echoes embedded in motion paths.

These are not broadcasts.
They are signatures.

“My movement leaves a signature — not blood.”

“You bleed. I leave fire.”

“Watch the trail. That’s where I was.”

Geo-Tag: NEXUS POINT ALPHA
Vector State: Inverted
Temporal Offset: −0.47s

STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT

Post-ignition environments exhibit adaptive behavior.

Edifices maintain levitation under anomalous load

Infrastructure warps into elastic geometry

Particulate matter stabilizes in suspended arcs

No systemic collapse recorded.

The environment is not breaking.

It is adjusting.

PRELIMINARY HYPOTHESIS (REJECTED)

Initial assumptions:

Experimental weapon systems

External energy infusion

Artificial augmentation

Verdict: Erroneous.

Subjects are not enhanced.

They are recalibrated — bodies mapped to symbiotic physics through Codium exposure.

CASCADE ALERT

Escalation Window: 48 hours

Additional coordinate overlaps detected (>3)

Secondary awakenings reported

Inter-reality drift accelerating

Projection: Nexus convergence imminent.
Containment Horizon: Collapsing.

DIRECTIVE STATUS

Event classified as IGNITION PRIME.

This is not an incident.

It is the beginning of a pattern.

Access restricted to subsequent dossiers:

CLASSIFIED-00-RECALIBRATION — Physics Expansion Protocols

CLASSIFIED-CODIUM-00 — Substrate Research

Oversight deferred to Shadow Initiative.

“We didn’t shatter the world.
We unfolded it.”
