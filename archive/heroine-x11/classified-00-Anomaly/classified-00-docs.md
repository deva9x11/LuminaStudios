# 🗂️ CLASSIFIED-00 // ANOMALY

EVENT: **IGNITION**  
ANOMALY TYPE: **CODIUM**  
OVERSIGHT RECORD: **RE-1**  
CLEARANCE LEVEL: **OMEGA-SECURE** 🔒
## INITIAL DETECTION PROTOCOL ⚠️

It arrived as **movement behaving incorrectly**.
Sensors remained nominal. Reality did not.

Objects traveled farther than expected.  
Momentum failed to decay.  
Bodies did not slow when they should have.

Initial reports were dismissed as calibration artifacts.

Then the threshold was crossed.

A human form moved in defiance of prediction.
## PRIMARY ACTIVATION SITES 🧭

Two independent activations were recorded across separate locations.

Designations:
- X11-S (Spectral Variant)
- X11-X (Xenophase Variant)

No shared origin.  
No shared environment.

Signatures matched harmonic resonance.  
Origins unresolved — *null convergence*.

Spatial anomalies registered immediately at activation.  
Dimensional bleed confirmed.
## COORDINATE NEXUS (PARTIAL DECRYPTION) 🌍

Interlinked loci suggest emergent multiversal tethering.  
Vertical orientation destabilized.  
Structures exhibited buoyancy under recalibrated fields.

Down ceased to be absolute.  
Direction became intent.
### NEXUS POINT ALPHA
W-03 / Φ-LAT 37.7749 / Ψ-VEC Δ-9.18  
ALTITUDE DRIFT: +87m  

ANOMALY: Inverted gravity wells.  
Debris maintains orbital suspension.  
STATUS: CONTAINMENT BREACHED — FLOATING ARCHITECTURE ACTIVE.
### NEXUS POINT BETA
W-07 / Φ-LAT −34.6037 / Ψ-VEC Δ+4.61  
ALTITUDE DRIFT: −112m  

ANOMALY: Axial skew.  
Pathways curve into non-linear traversal routes.  
STATUS: SYNCHRONIZED OVERLAP — INTER-WORLD ECHOES DETECTED.
### NEXUS POINT GAMMA (EMERGENT)
W-12 / Φ-LAT 51.5074 / Ψ-VEC Δ0.00  
ALTITUDE DRIFT: VARIABLE  

ANOMALY: Phased layering.  
Matter intermittently loses solidity.  
STATUS: ESCALATING — POTENTIAL GATEWAY FORMATION.
These coordinates do not mark locations.

They mark **connections**.
## MANIFESTED PHENOMENA 🌀

Subjects do not exceed physical limits.

They are **reinterpreted by them**.

Documented effects include:
- Thermal afterimages without ignition source
- Aerodynamic vortices channeling kinetic force
- Velocity vectors unbound by friction or decay
- Gravimetric distortion enabling mid-traversal reorientation

Momentum persists where it should not.

Space yields.
## INTERCEPTED TRANSMISSIONS (VOICE LOGS) 🎙️

Phase events produced localized resonance echoes embedded in motion paths.

These are not broadcasts.  
They are **signatures**.

"My movement leaves a signature — not blood."  
"You bleed. I leave fire."  
"Watch the trail. That’s where I was."

Geo-Tag: NEXUS POINT ALPHA  
Vector State: Inverted  
Temporal Offset: −0.47s
## STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT 🏗️

Post-ignition environments exhibit adaptive behavior.

- Edifices maintain levitation under anomalous load
- Infrastructure warps into elastic geometry
- Particulate matter stabilizes in suspended arcs

No systemic collapse recorded.

The environment is not breaking.

It is **adjusting**.

## PRELIMINARY HYPOTHESIS (REJECTED) ❌

Initial assumptions:
- Experimental weapon systems
- External energy infusion
- Artificial augmentation

Verdict: Erroneous.

Subjects are not enhanced.

They are **recalibrated** — bodies mapped to symbiotic physics through Codium exposure.
## CASCADE ALERT ⏱️

Escalation Window: 48 hours

- Additional coordinate overlaps detected (>3)
- Secondary awakenings reported
- Inter-reality drift accelerating

Projection: Nexus convergence imminent.  
Containment Horizon: Collapsing.
## DIRECTIVE STATUS 📑

Event classified as **IGNITION PRIME**.

This is not an incident.

It is the beginning of a pattern we no longer control.


Access restricted to subsequent dossiers:

- CLASSIFIED-CODIUM-00 — Substrate Research

Oversight deferred to **Shadow Initiative**.

We unfolded it."
