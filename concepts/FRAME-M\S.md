# 🚀 FRAME - Game Design Document

## CORE IDENTITY
**FRAME** stands for:  
**F**ast  
**R**eal-time  
**A**ction &  
**M**ovement  
**E**nergy  

FRAME is a high-octane action game where **movement is the source of power**. Speed, flow, and spatial mastery outshine raw damage, delivering a player fantasy of seamless control and unstoppable momentum.

## CORE VISION
FRAME thrives on **motion as combat**. Stopping is a risk; flowing is dominance.  
- Moving rewards with energy and options.  
- Every mechanic reinforces this loop, from chaining dashes to outmaneuvering foes.  
**Goal:** Craft a world where players never want to stand still.

## GAMEPLAY PILLARS
### 1. Movement Fuels Energy  
- **Player Love:** Running, jumping, dashing, and redirecting build energy—skill unlocks power.  
- **Dev Joy:** Energy scales with mastery (speed, combo length), not timers, offering deep tuning potential.  
- **Example:** A wall-run into a mid-air pivot fills your bar for a momentum-fueled strike.  

### 2. Real-Time Action  
- **Player Love:** No pauses—every move flows in the moment, keeping adrenaline high.  
- **Dev Joy:** Real-time demands responsive AI and physics, rewarding tight design.  
- **Example:** Dodge a lunge mid-dash, turning their mistake into your advantage.  

### 3. Flow Over Buttons  
- **Player Love:** Smooth transitions (dash-to-strike, swing-to-jump) make you a fluid force, not a button masher.  
- **Dev Joy:** Animation blending and input buffering become design art, enhancing player expression.  
- **Example:** Slide into an upward kick, preserving speed for the next move.  

### 4. Readable, Skill-Based Combat  
- **Player Love:** Enemies telegraph based on your position—mastery feels earned.  
- **Dev Joy:** Clear patterns and hitboxes balance challenge, letting skill shine.  
- **Example:** An enemy overextends—reposition and punish their recovery.

## PLAYER FANTASY
You’re not a soldier or hero—you’re **motion incarnate**.  
- **Power:** Dominate by reading space, outmoving enemies, and thriving under pressure.  
- **Moment:** Nail a multi-surface dash to flank a foe, energy peaking as the crowd roars.  
- **Emotion:** The thrill of outsmarting danger fuels every close call.

## STYLE & TONE
- **Aesthetic:** Clean, modern, and sharp—visuals prioritize readability (enemy tells, movement trails) over clutter.  
- **Tone:** Grounded yet dynamic—no lore overload, just a world shaped by speed.  
- **Effects:** Sleek energy pulses and motion blur highlight skill, not noise.  

---

## DEVELOPMENT STATUS
- **Stage:** Concept & early prototyping  
- **Focus:** Perfecting movement feel, energy flow, and real-time combat responsiveness  
- **Direction:** Skill-driven, fast-paced, player-expressive gameplay  
- **Next Steps:** Iterate core loop, test enemy reactivity, refine visual feedback  

---

## FUTURE HOOKS
- Multiplayer duels where movement decides victory.  
- Dynamic arenas with shifting walls or collapsing floors.  
- Unlockable movement styles (e.g., dash chains, phase steps).
