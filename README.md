# Lumina Studios

Lumina Studios is an independent game development workspace focused on
creating games where movement feels *alive* — smooth, weighty, and
instinctive, like controlling a body in motion rather than a character
on rails. 🧠⚡

We design gameplay that flows — as momentum builds, motion bends slightly
before releasing into speed — roll, jump, wall-run, swing, land — where
momentum carries forward without friction and control never breaks. 🌊🌀

## Focus
- High-mobility FPS concepts built around parkour, momentum, and vertical
  freedom — rolling through space, rebounding off walls, chaining jumps,
  and maintaining speed without interruption. 🧗‍♂️↔️⬆️
- Movement systems inspired by *feel-first* design: smooth wall rolls,
  mid-air direction control, controlled falls, impact landings, and
  physics-driven traversal that lets players swing, glide, and fly
  across the map. 🔨💨
- Experimental prototyping centered on sensation — input timing,
  animation blending, sound feedback, camera motion, and subtle weight
  shifts that make movement feel fluid like water 💧 or elastic like
  steel under force. ⚙️🌊

## Projects
This repository contains internal design concepts and early documentation
for multiple original game ideas, each exploring different ways to make
movement, combat, and environment interaction feel intuitive, expressive,
and deeply fun to master. 🎮✨

Status: Concept & early development phase.
